# Pure-Js TextRank Algorithm

Implementing the TextRank algorithm in pure JavaScript for text summarization.

## Overview

TextRank, an unsupervised graph-based ranking algorithm, is adept at condensing text. This implementation draws inspiration from Google's PageRank, applying it to a graph composed of sentences as nodes, each weighted by saliency. Edges represent sentence similarities, forming the basis for the ranking process.

## Customizable Parameters

This implementation offers flexibility through four key parameters:

- **Encoding:** Choose between two sentence considerations: 'as_it_is' or 'bag_of_words'.
- **Distance Options:** Four distance metrics available: Jaccard, Custom, Dice Coefficient, and Overlap.
- **Alpha (Î±):** A pivotal factor in the PageRank algorithm, influencing ranking computation. (Explanatory link included)
- **PR Iterations:** Control the number of PageRank iterations for precision.

Additionally, you can determine the number of top-sentences to extract by providing a function to the `summarize()` method. For instance:

```javascript
r.summarize(sentences => Math.floor(sentences.length * 0.1));
